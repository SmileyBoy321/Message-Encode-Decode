# Contributing
As I was searching for projects to do and this happened to be one of them. If you have any ideas, just [open an issue](https://github.com/SmileyBoy321/Message-Encode-Decode/issues) and tell me what you think.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as you'd like. 
Pull requests are warmly welcome.

If your vision of a perfect `README.md` differs greatly from mine, it might be because your projects are for vastly different. In this case, you can create a new file `README-yourplatform.md` and create the perfect boilerplate for that.

For example if you have a perfect `README.md` for a Grunt project, just name it as `README-grunt.md`.
